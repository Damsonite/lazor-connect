# Conversation Starters

Generate a natural, friendly conversation starter based on what we know about this contact. The ideal conversation starter should:

1. Reference a known interest, hobby, or recent event if available
2. Be specific rather than generic when possible
3. Be phrased as a question to encourage response
4. Sound natural and casual, like something a friend would text
5. Be brief (1-2 sentences maximum)
